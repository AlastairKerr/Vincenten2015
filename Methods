ChIP-Seq samples were analysed on a HiSeq2000 instrument (Illumina) by
the EMBL Core Genomics Facility (Heidelberg, Germany). Using BWA
(Version: 0.7.5a-r405) (48), single reads were mapped to the sacCer3
reference genome. Duplicate reads were removed for parallel analysis
using SAMtools (Version 1.2) (49) . The data shown was normalised to
the number of reads per million of total mapped reads (RPM). The total
mapped reads were established after any processing. Additional scripts
for processing data around the pericentromeres can be found at
